                    <h3>Why Mariners Games Feel So Expensive (Hint: It’s Not the Tickets)</h3>
                    <p>If you’ve ever looked at Mariners ticket prices and thought, “Hey, that’s not so bad,” you’re not wrong. Compared to other major league teams, tickets at T-Mobile Park are actually pretty reasonable — especially for weekday games or upper-deck seats.<br>

But where fans really feel the pinch is once they’re inside the ballpark. The cost of food and drinks can easily double or triple what you spent on admission. A basic combo — say, a hot dog, fries, and a drink — can set you back nearly as much as your ticket. Add a craft beer or two (Seattle’s specialty), and suddenly a “cheap” night out turns into a mini splurge.<br>

It’s not just about prices, either — the Mariners have leaned into offering a wide range of premium eats, from poke bowls to gourmet burgers, all sourced from local vendors. It’s great for the taste buds, but not so much for the wallet.<br>

So yes, Mariners games can feel expensive, but it’s not because you’re overpaying to get in — it’s because the food lineup inside the park is so tempting (and pricey) that it’s hard to say no.</p>
